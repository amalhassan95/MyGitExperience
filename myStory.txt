Walt immediately returns home to gather the money to pay the disappearer. 
Unfortunately, when he looks at the money he has stowed in his crawl space, he finds most of it missing. 
A distraught Skyler finds Walt in the crawl space. Walt asks where the money is in a panic;

Realizing that now he had been fucked by Ted, Walt completely loses his grip

As a terrified Skyler gets a voicemail message from Marie about how Hank's life is in danger again, 
Walt is left in the crawl space, cackling like a madman before falling catatonic...
